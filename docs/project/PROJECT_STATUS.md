# Project Status

- **Last updated:** 2026-09-30 (micro-phase 1.1)
- **Repository:** https://github.com/haricodes2970/Hari_OS
- **Branch:** `main`

## Current Phase

| Phase | Name | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Foundation infrastructure | **Complete** |
| 1 | Application foundation | **Active** |

**Phase 0 is complete.** All eight micro-phases are done and verified.

**Phase 1 is active.** Micro-phase 1.1 has established the V1 SQLite schema. No feature code
exists yet: the schema stores facts, and nothing reads or writes it.

## Current Micro-Phase

**1.1 — Data schema foundation: COMPLETE AND VERIFIED**

Next micro-phase: **1.2 — not yet defined in detail.** Its scope must be planned before work
begins. Phase 1's overall scope is recorded in
`docs/phases/PHASE_01_FOUNDATION.md`; the micro-phase breakdown beyond 1.1 is not invented
here.

## Active Work

None.

## Blockers

None.

## Current State

- Next.js 16.3.7 (App Router, Turbopack) + React 19.2.8 + TypeScript 5, npm 10.9.8.
- ESLint 9 flat config from `eslint-config-next`, plus a `hari-os/boundaries` rule that
  keeps `src/domain/` and `src/components/` free of database, storage, and command
  imports. Prettier 3.9.9.
- Architecture established and documented in `docs/project/ARCHITECTURE.md`:
  `app/`, `components/`, `features/`, `domain/`, `commands/`, `lib/db/`, `lib/storage/`,
  `lib/validation/`.
- SQLite foundation in place via `src/lib/db/connection.ts`, using `better-sqlite3@13`.
  The database creates itself at `data/hari-os.db` on first access, with WAL journaling
  and foreign keys enabled. Verified by `npm run db:check`.
- **V1 schema implemented in micro-phase 1.1.** Eleven PRD tables plus `schema_migrations`,
  created by an ordered migration in `src/lib/db/migrations.ts`. `npm run db:check` verifies
  tables, columns, constraints, and the absence of unexpected tables.
  `npm run db:test` runs 53 isolated tests on temporary databases.
  **No seed data exists and no business operation reads or writes the schema yet.**
- `connection.ts` imports `server-only`, so a Client Component importing it fails the
  build. Verified with a probe route.
- Only `src/app/` and `src/lib/db/` contain code. `components/`, `features/`, `domain/`,
  `commands/`, `lib/storage/`, and `lib/validation/` still hold boundary READMEs only.
- No repositories, services, or query modules for the schema yet.
- No parser, no LLM dependency, no OpenRouter, no feature pages, no authentication, no
  uploads, no test framework beyond the two database scripts.
- `AGENTS.md` at the repository root holds the persistent engineering rules for coding
  agents: project identity, canonical sources of truth, stack, architecture boundaries,
  database rules, data and secret safety, the LLM boundary, product principles, Git and
  micro-phase workflow, verification expectations, scope control, and documentation
  discipline. It deliberately carries no live status.
- Environment handling is explicit: a tracked `.env.example` documents the single variable
  the code reads, `HARI_OS_DB_PATH`. No `.env` file is committed. Every secret and
  local-data ignore rule has been proven against real files, including WAL sidecars and a
  database created outside `data/`.
- Localhost only, no deployment.


## Tooling

| Script | Command |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the development server |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run start` | Serve the production build |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `npm run format` | `prettier --write .` |
| `npm run format:check` | `prettier --check .` |
| `npm run db:check` | Apply migrations and verify the V1 schema |
| `npm run db:test` | Isolated schema and constraint tests on temporary databases |

## Verification Status for 1.1

| Check | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Install | `npm install` | Pass — 0 vulnerabilities |
| Formatting | `npm run format:check` | Pass |
| TypeScript | `npm run typecheck` | Pass — 0 errors |
| Lint | `npm run lint` | Pass — 0 errors, 0 warnings |
| Production build | `npm run build` | Pass |
| Schema present | `npm run db:check` | Pass — 11 V1 tables, columns, constraints verified |
| Migration idempotent | `npm run db:test` | Pass — re-running applies nothing |
| Migrations non-destructive | `npm run db:test` | Pass — existing rows survive, no table dropped |
| Fresh vs migrated schema | `npm run db:test` | Pass — identical |
| Constraints reject bad data | `npm run db:test` | Pass — 24 accept/reject cases |
| `db:check` failure detection | `npm run db:test` | Pass — missing table, unexpected table, missing column all fail it |
| Unknown version refused | `npm run db:test` | Pass |
| Real database preserved | row counts | Pass — 12 tables, only the migration record, no user data |
| `data/` ignored | `git check-ignore` | Pass — no database file tracked |
| Secrets or data staged | `git status` | Pass — none |

`npm run db:test` reports **53 passed, 0 failed** and removes all 10 temporary databases it
creates. It never opens the real `data/hari-os.db`.

## Phase 0 Deliverables

- Next.js 16.3.7 + TypeScript application that builds, serves, and renders
- ESLint 9 with an architecture boundary rule that fails the build on violations
- Prettier 3.9.9, `format` and `format:check` scripts
- Directory architecture with `hari-os/boundaries` enforced, not merely documented
- SQLite foundation: `data/hari-os.db`, created on demand, verified by `npm run db:check`
- `server-only` guard proven to fail a build on client import
- `.env.example` plus a proven ignore boundary for every secret and local-data path
- `AGENTS.md` carrying persistent engineering rules
- `docs/` navigation, roadmap, and phase documents for Phases 1–9
- `docs/sessions/2026-09-29-session-01.md` and `docs/sessions/2026-09-30-session-01.md`

**Deliberately not built in Phase 0:** any product feature, any feature schema, the command
parser, OpenRouter, authentication, deployment, PWA packaging, uploads, and test
infrastructure.

## Latest Commit

`73ed2b3` — `docs(0.8): establish project documentation system`

## Next Action

**1.2 is not yet defined in detail.** The natural candidate is the first feature slice end to
end — a route, a feature, a domain rule, and `src/lib/db/` — starting with whichever PRD area
gives the most value. The Phase 1 scope in `docs/phases/PHASE_01_FOUNDATION.md` expects a
real data round trip and negative cases.

One open item is carried forward: the **PRD-versus-roadmap scope divergence** recorded in
`docs/project/ROADMAP.md` is unresolved. The PRD frames V1 as a 2–3 hour prototype; the
roadmap spreads the same surface across nine phases. The user decides which governs.

## Known Issues

- `npm install` prints `npm warn deprecated eslint@9.39.5`. This comes from
  `eslint-config-next@16.3.7`'s own dependency range, not from a package chosen here. It is
  upstream and is not an introduced warning. No configuration was weakened to suppress it.
  Re-evaluate when Next ships a config on a supported ESLint major.
